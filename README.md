# Notes App

NotesApp is a versatile application for taking quick notes, making checklists, A notesapp organize daily notes,
manage daily lists, to-do tasks, daily items, ideas, and work plans. If anyone wants to note on planning daily top list
items, this app organizes all your stuff like Notes, Tasks, PDF, image upload, or backup in one place. It will be helpful for all
users who use this notes app and users can backup their photos, pdf, or private notes in this app.

# Motivation 

The main purpose of making this app is it's data backup system. When we were thinking about anything to make,
we thought that there are many types of notes app but all apps have no data privacy system. If we implement this kind of
system in our app, it will ensure the user's privacy. For that reason, we are trying to build this app though many
functionalities will be added.
